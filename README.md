# P06_STRIPS
This is an implementation of a solution to the [monkey and bananas problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_and_banana_problem) using [STRIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STRIPS) and [PDDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_Domain_Definition_Language). We also use the [strips library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/strips) for JavaScript for the interpretation of tne PDDL files.
